Developed using Jetpack Compose for a modern and responsive UI, the app integrates with the TMDB API to display a vast collection of movies across various categories such as Action, Comedy, Drama, and more.

To ensure smooth data fetching and efficient memory management, Retrofit is used for API requests, while Room Database and Paging 3 handle offline caching and infinite scrolling. Users can effortlessly explore trending and popular movies, thanks to the appâ€™s optimized pagination.

For user management, Firebase Authentication allows secure login and signup options. Additionally, users can create a personalized experience by adding movies to their Favorites Section, which is stored using Firebase Firestore. This makes it easy to manage and access their favorite movies across multiple devices.

The app is built with a robust architecture using Dagger Hilt for dependency injection, ensuring clean and maintainable code.
